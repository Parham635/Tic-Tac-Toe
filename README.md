# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Algorithm
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Go, featuring a computer player that uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. The game allows two players to take turns (one as "X" and the other as "O") and continues until there is a winner or a draw.
